                Humanity has come a long way with regard to video games. Starting with the first one, Pong which now
                seems
                rudimentary; up to recent AAA blockbusters such as Call of Duty and Fortnite, video games have become an
                inseparable part of our culture. While some tend to consider them as playing futilely and running away
                from
                more important commitments, there are indications that even video games could help individuals achieve
                better results in their work. In this article, we will be discussing how they can boost productivity
                using
                various examples for illustration purposes.

                Enhancement of cognitive abilities
            </div>
            <div class="blog_para">One primary advantage of playing video games is that it enhances your cognitive
                skills.
                Several studies have shown that playing video games may improve problem-solving ability, decision-making
                and
                critical thinking amongst others. For instance, a recent study by the University of Rochester utilized
                action video games to demonstrate how being exposed to fast-paced visual stimuli can influence
                perception
                and thus judgment making processes. The research found out that people who played action video games
                could
                make 25% faster accurate decisions as compared to those who didn’t game at all.</div>
            <div class="blog_para">
                In the journal Nature, another study has discovered that video games may help you multitask better. The
                study participants were asked to play a game where they had to switch between tasks. The findings showed
                that gamers could switch from one activity to another faster and more accurately than non-gamers. This
                ability of better multitasking may make them more productive in real life situations like schools or
                workplace settings.

                Lessening Tension
            </div>
            <div class="blog_para">A significant part of decline in efficiency is caused by the stress we experience.
                Work becomes difficult to concentrate on and tasks may not be finished during periods of tension.
                However video games aid in alleviating strain and increasing output. When people engage in virtual
                entertainment, their brains generate dopamine, which is associated with feelings of mirth, compensation
                for good behavior etc. By triggering dopamine release from the brain regions responsible for pleasure,
                it helps to ease anxiety and improves one’s state of mind.</div>
            <div class="blog_para">
                Also, playing videogames can literally offer a temporal break from the stressors of modern living. Video
                games offer us a virtual place where we are able to fully engage with it as per own will. It may be an
                enjoyable distraction from work or class, helping us regain some energy before heading back to tackle
                them again.

                Growth of motivation
            </div>
            <div class="blog_para">Productivity is greatly affected by motivation. When we are inspired, we tend to put
                more effort into our work and pay more attention to our goals. It could be said that video games can
                serve as effective motivators because they give us satisfaction and improvement. Videogames typically
                have specific aims and ambitions, so that once players finish their tasks or missions they feel a
                certain sense of accomplishment.</div>
            <div class="blog_para">In addition, video gaming will often provide us with fast feedback and incentives;
                thus they can motivate us effectively. Normally, as we accomplish a task or aim in the game we earn
                points, rewards among other types of motivations. This feeling of reward may increase our motivation and
                determination to complete tasks in real-life situations.</div>

                Expanding imaginative power
            </div>
            <div class="blog_para">Another significant part of being able to work productively is creativity. When
                creative thought moments happen, we’re likely to think of other solutions and proposals. Playing video
                games can foster imagination, as they require young men and men to think of innovative solutions for
                them or consider unconventional ideas.</div>
            <div class="blog_para">An instance of such creativity is seen in Mine-craft and Terra-rium where individual
                players can create their own spaces and buildings with their own designs. In other types of games like
                puzzlers or strategy games, players are required to engage their brains more than ever before when it
                comes down to resolving issues and overcoming obstacles.</div>
